Forgot password option: 
Create a page and route to reset the password using email or phone number.
user can request forgot password only 1 time a day 
if they do twice we should show warning message like use only time, 
we should have feature called password generator where we will generate random password . 
the random password should not have any special character and numbers and 
it should be combination of Small and upper case.

IMPORTANT NOTE: while deploy the project i used railway( for db) render(for backend ) and vercel(for frontend)
All platforms i used are free tier so basically while using the site while click on link refresh the page first ( for awaken the backend) .
dont rush if it dont response immediately wait for bit cause(as per free tier it will take time) for response to your requests like login regiter etc
